                <p><b>Procedure for Lag/Slow Disconnection:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="rule-point">In case of lag/slow, the screen recorder should be turned on and the match should be disconnected by pausing the game with <b>clear evidence</b>.</li>
                    <li class="rule-point">However, the official/matchday admin can give a <b>yellow card</b> for disconnecting for ‘any issue’ other than lag/slow evidence.</li>
                    <li class="rule-point">Article 4 should be followed regarding the video rules of disconnected matches.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p><b>Rematch Protocol:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li class="rule-point">For the remaining minutes of the match, the completed minutes should be subtracted from the total <b>93 minutes</b> and the remaining time should be played from the beginning of the rematch. The match time must be determined and the squad/manager/formation of the game can be changed if necessary.</li>
                <li class="rule-point">Multiple cards can be given for multiple disconnections. However, the cards should be given within <b>10 minutes</b> of the disconnection and before the start of the rematch.</li>
                <li class="rule-point">In case of creating a room in a disconnected match, it will not be considered who had the ball. The person who will show the <b>win</b> will have to create a room in the rematch at his/her own will.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Goal Counting:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li class="rule-point">All goals clearly proven by screenshots or screen records added to the scoreboard or in the ball goal bar will be counted.</li>
                <li class="rule-point">Sometimes, the game continues for some time even after one side is disconnected. In that case, if goal proof can be provided, the goal will be counted. But goals after <b>1 second</b> of the scheduled time of the rematch will not be counted.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><b>Player Responsibility & Network Issues:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li class="rule-point">If the eFootball app crashes during the game and the game is closed, it is an <b>internal disconnected issue</b>. In this case, the sole responsibility lies with the player's own device. The opponent will not compromise/compensate for anything.</li>
                <li class="rule-point">In both cases of <b>electrical failure and wifi disconnected</b>, [Network Error] is displayed instead of win/lose during the match. If lose/network error is shown from the lead, a video with the <b>user ID || device</b> must be provided. Otherwise, the lead will not count.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Red Card/Forfeit Scenario:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li class="rule-point">If a player in the In-Game team receives a red card during the match and leaves the game without a slow game/lag proof video, the player will be given a <b>red card</b>.</li>
                <li class="rule-point">However, if the lag/slow proof video is not available after leaving the game with the video, the player will be given a <b>yellow card</b> and the opponent will have... (Original text incomplete, assumed a penalty follows).</li>
